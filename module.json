  "description": "<p><span><strong>Undead Adversaries</strong> adds 60 new Daggerheart-compatible statblocks, expanding your repertoire of undead types including ghosts, vampires, mummies, and fungus-infected varieties.</span></p><p><span>At least one adversary is included for each Role at each Tier. For example, there is a Tier 1 Solo (the Plague Troll), a Tier 2 Solo (the Vampire Spawn), a Tier 3 Solo (the Bone Naga) and a Tier 4 Solo (the Mummy Pharaoh). This lets you compose varied encounters against undead at every tier of play.</span></p><p><span>Pester your party with a Poltergeist inhabiting a haunted house. Have your party contend with a seemingly intelligent horde of infected zombies led by a Mycelial Coordinator. Terrorize players with the overwhelming force of a Feral Vampire. Unleash the three-stage Dragon Lich as the final BBEG of a undead-slaying campaign.</span></p><p><span>Also comes with 4 new Environment statblocks: the Graveyard, the Mycelial Overgrowth, the Ancient Mausoleum, and the Vampire Clan's Estate.</span></p>",
